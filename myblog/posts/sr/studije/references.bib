  abstract = {Mechanistic disease models are at the heart of disease ecology and have generated fundamental biological insights, ranging from our understanding of disease-density thresholds to the influence of host heterogeneity on the spread of disease. The definition of a mechanistic model is actually debated quite a lot, but here I am referring specifically to systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can capture the important non-linearities and temporal dynamics of infection, which are founded on the idea of transmission from infectious hosts to susceptible hosts. This is probably the simplest example:},

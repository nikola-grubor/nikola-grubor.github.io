I am a medical doctor and PhD student of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics at the Belgrade Medical School Institute for Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics. I aim to make the science of medicine more approachable to the public and help researchers answer interesting questions. Bayesian scientific modeling offers a unique approach to quantifying uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge via domain expertise elicitation, which can aid small and underfunded research teams in making a more significant impact. I have experience working in large research teams and managing communication with large groups of students. My involvement in patient care has led me to develop skills in making complex topics more approachable.
